Feature: Sort Courses
  As an admin,
  So that I can view courses in a certain order,
  I want to be able to sort courses.

  Background: there are several courses
    Given these courses:
      | crn | course_name | title | instructor | days | starts | ends | building_room | credits|
      | 10003 | MATH_323 | Abstraact Algebra | Saracino | MWF | 1020 | 1120 | McGregory 205 | 1 |
      | 10001 | COSC_320 | Algorithms | Stratton | MWF | 1120 | 1220 | McGregory 105 | 1 |
      | 10002 | COSC_480 | Cloud Computing | Sommers | MWF | 1320 | 1435 | Lawrence 105 | 1 |

      And I should see "COSC_480" before "MATH_323"

    Scenario: sort courses by Title
      Given I am on the courses page
      When I press "Title"
